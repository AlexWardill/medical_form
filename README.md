## Medical form task

Using Django, create a form satisfying the following properties:

 - [x] enter their name, email address, UK based phone number,
address details 
- [ ] and a medical condition from a dropdown list.
- [x] The information must then be stored
in the database of your choice. (sqlite3) 
- [ ] Automatically send a ‘Thank you for Registering your interest’ email. 
Note - The email component does not need to be fully functioning, but the code must be visible.

- [x] The form must be responsive across all devices and must be styled using either CSS/SCSS/Bootstrap
etc.
- [x] Clear the database.

As this was my first experience with Django, I have been a bit hasty with the styling and gone for some simple (and rough) boilerplate bootstrap.
Also the project structure is slightly unrefined, I found myself wanting to add more apps and templates to try and anticipate better efficiency should the application be scaled up. But obviously this is not necessary here and only lead to wasted time...

Regardless, I enjoyed the quick learning under a bit of pressure, thanks for the opportunity.
